## Program Snippet Descriptions (7 marks)
### Approach 1
```
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```
Defines function `doubleL(n)` that:
- Initializes list `res`
- Caluclates values in for in loop, and appends value to `res` on each iteration
- Returns list `res`

After it then iterates through the returned list, printing the value and appending ` : ` to the end rather than `\n`

### Approach 2
```
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```
Directly creates a list of doubled values using a list comprehension (no intermediate list as used in Approach 1)

### Approach 3
```
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```
Calculates each value when it's needed on the fly (doesn't store values in a list)


## What type of function is `double6(n)`? What's the advantage of using this type of function? (3 marks)
`double6(n)` is a **generator** function, which caluclates the value only when required.
The advantage to this is that it is more memory effecient (isn't caluclating all the values at once and storing it to be used).
Very useful when working with large datasets.
